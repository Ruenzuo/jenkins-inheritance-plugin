	This field is only used when you specify the same compatibility
	with another project multiple times.<br/>
	Do note that this feature may have been deactivated in the
	Project Creation Engine, in which case only the first instance defined here
	will be used and this field will be ignored. This also happens, if the
	field is left empty on more	than one of the multiple mentions.
