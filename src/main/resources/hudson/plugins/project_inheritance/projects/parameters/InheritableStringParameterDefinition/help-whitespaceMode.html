<div>
This field allows you to select, how whitespaces at the start/end of the
parameter should be handled, when a build is started:
<ol>
	<li>Trim all leading/trailing whitespace from the entered value.</li>
	<li>Keep the whitespace intact, exactly as the user entered it.</li>
	<li>Keep the whitespace, but make sure that at least a single space
		is added to the front of the value, in case it <b>extends</b> a
		parameter with the same name from a parent.
	</li>
</ol>
Select the first option, if you know the parameter should not have leading or
trailing spaces.<br/>
Select the third option, if you are constructing a parameter that is used in
flag- or command-construction. For example Compiler Flags.<br/>
Otherwise, or if in doubt, just select the second option.
<p>
Do note that, if trimming is selected, this has an effect on both the default
value used for automatically started builds, as well as user-initiated builds
where the user had a chance to alter the parameter value.
