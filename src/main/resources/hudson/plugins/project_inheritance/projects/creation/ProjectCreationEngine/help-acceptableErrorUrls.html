<div>
Normally, job configuration pages can only be saved, if there are no errors
present (the red text underneath input fields).<br/>
This field allows you to specify full class names, whose errors should be
ignored in this regard and allow a save, even if errors are present.
<br/><br/>
Each line is treated as a single pattern and stripped of whitespace.
Empty lines are ignored. There are no comments permitted.
<br/><br/>
The patterns are matched against the 'checkUrl' attributes of the input fields
and tested for whether the URL contains the given pattern. If at least one
is matched, all errors raised by that field are ignored.
<br/><br/>
These 'checkUrl' attributes usually take a form of:
<ul>
	<li>descriptorByName/hudson.tasks.ArtifactArchiver/checkArtifacts</li>
</ul>
As such, giving the full class name is usually enough to precisely ignore only
these error fields. You can always check the 'checkurl' values with the
'Inspect this element' functionality of your browser of choice.
